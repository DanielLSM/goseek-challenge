# goseek-challenge

Welcome to the GOSEEK challenge page, which is run in conjunction with [Perception, Action, Learning Workshop](https://mit-spark.github.io/PAL-ICRA2020/) at [ICRA 2020](www.icra2020.org).

For this competition, participants create a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that combines perception and high-level decision-making to search for objects placed within complex indoor environments from a Unity-based simulator. Simply put: like PACMAN, but in a realistic scene and with realistic perception capabilities. Several data modalities are provided from both the simulator ground truth and a perception pipeline (e.g., images, depth, agent location) to enable the participants to focus on the RL/search aspects. The contest will be hosted on the EvalAI platform, where participants will submit solutions, via docker containers run on AWS instances, for scoring.
